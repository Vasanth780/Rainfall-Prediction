# Rainfall-Prediction

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of weather-related features, including temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether it will rain or not based on historical weather data.

# Technologies Used

 # Python - Main programming language

- Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

- NumPy – Numerical operations

- Matplotlib – Data visualization

- Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

- Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation


 # Features Used

- Wind speed

- Wind direction

- Temperature (Max and Min)

- Outlier removal for data cleaning

- Feature selection using correlation analysis

# Steps in the Project

1. Data Loading & Cleaning
- Load dataset and check for missing values.
- Remove unnecessary spaces and handle null values.

  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize distributions of features.

- Detect and handle outliers.

- Perform correlation analysis to remove redundant features.

3.  Model Training & Evaluation

- Split data into training and testing sets.

- Train different machine learning models such as:

- Decision Tree Classifier

- Random Forest Classifier

- XGBoost Classifier

- Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, and recall.

4.Predictions & Insights

- Compare model performance.

- Make predictions and interpret the results.

  # How to Run the Project

1. Install required dependencies using:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

2.Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (Rainfall_Prediction.ipynb).

3.Follow the step-by-step code execution to understand the workflow.

# Future Improvements

- Use deep learning models for better accuracy.

- Include additional weather parameters like humidity and air pressure.

- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.

  # Conclusion

  This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to analyze weather data and predict rainfall. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques, we can build a robust predictive model.
