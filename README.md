# Rainfall-Prediction

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of weather-related features, including temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether it will rain or not based on historical weather data.

# Technologies Used

- Python – Main programming language

- Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing

- NumPy – Numerical operations

- Matplotlib – Data visualization

- Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

- Scikit-learn – Machine learning models and evaluation


 # Features Used

- Wind speed

- Wind direction

- Temperature (Max and Min)

- Outlier removal for data cleaning

- Feature selection using correlation analysis

# Steps in the Project

1.Data Loading & Cleaning
- Load dataset and check for missing values.
- Remove unnecessary spaces and handle null values.
